# rsqlite

Provides a read-only interface to a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) database file. Not to be confused 
with [RSQLite](https://github.com/r-dbi/RSQLite). That package is a bit more complicated than 
this one due to its greater functionality and the considerable boilerplate code that goes along with
the [R-DBI](https://www.r-dbi.org/) project. By contrast, this package just sticks to the simple API 
functions provided by the SQLite library.
